NODE
There are several different installation instructions using Homebrew and other methods but the easiest is to install the Mac Installer Package straight from Node.js. Once it is downloaded, open the package and follow the instructions. The default installation path is /usr/local/bin/node but you can change that to the path of your choosing. The great thing about the Mac Installer Package is that it also installs Node Package Manager (npm) which, in the past, used to be a separate install. The default installation path for npm is /usr/local/bin/npm. http://nodejs.org/download/

node -v
brew install node
mkdir basic; cd basic;
npm init #create a package.json file for you
server.js < "console.log('May you be Safe")
node server.js
npm install express --save

npm install nodemon --save-dev 
alias nodem="./node_modules/.bin/nodemon server.js"
